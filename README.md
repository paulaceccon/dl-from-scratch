# Machine Learning from Scratch

Implementation of machine learning algorithms, for study purposes.
They are presented through notebooks, so you can understand and visualize any outputs
without needing to run any code.


## Quick Start

### Playing notebooks online (no installation required)

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/paulaceccon/ml-from-scratch/blob/main/" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

### Inspecting notebooks (without executing any code)

* <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/paulaceccon/ml-from-scratch/blob/main/index.ipynb"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg" alt="Render nbviewer" /></a>

* [github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/index.ipynb) also works, but it's not ideal: it's slower, the math equations are not always displayed correctly, and large notebooks often fail to open.
